This directory contains the second edition of the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test
Database.  The directory includes noise records (`bw', `em', and `ma') that may
be added to ECG records by `nst' to create noise stress test records.  It also
contains 12 sample noise stress test records generated by `nst', by adding `em'
noise to MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records 118 and 119.  File `nstdbgen' is
the UNIX shell script that was used to generate the sample records.  For
convenience, reference annotation files are included here; all are copies of
the original reference annotation files for records 118 and 119.  The
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) during the noisy segments of these records are:

	Record	SNR (dB)	Record	SNR (dB)

	118e24	24		119e24	24 
	118e18	18		119e18	18
	118e12	12		119e12	12
	118e06	 6		119e06	 6
	118e00	 0		119e00	 0
	118e_6	-6		119e_6	-6

The records with SNRs of 0 and -6 dB are written in format 16, since the sample
values occasionally exceed the 12-bit range enforced by format 212 (used for
the other records in this directory).

The directory `old' contains the first edition of the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test
Database, reproduced here for the sake of completeness.  Unless you wish to
repeat an experiment based on the first edition, use the records in this
directory.
